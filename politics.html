		<li><h2> Lok Sabha polls: Record polling in Kerala stumps all Fronts, parties unsure of outcome
The highest polling in a Lok Sabha election in Kerala in 30 yrs appears to have upset the calculations of the three main contenders, CPI(M)-led LDF, Congress-headed UDF and NDA led by BJP
</h2></li><br>
		
		Engagement: 60
The highest polling in a Lok Sabha election in the State in 30 years – 77.68% seems to have upset the calculations of the three main contenders in Kerala: the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Congress-headed United Democratic Front (UDF) and the National Democratic Alliance led by the BJP.
For the record, all the fronts are putting up a brave face claiming that the heavy polling would benefit them the most. But, privately, they are admitting to a feeling of nervousness about the result.
The UDF is, of course, the most confident of the lot. The front’s optimism is based on two factors: the Rahul factor and the unprecedented consolidation of minority votes in its favour. This reality would see the front romp home the winner in at least 16 to 17 seats! A tall claim, argues both the LDF and the NDA.
Voting pattern across the state encompassing the three regions – south Kerala, central Kerala and Malabar point to the existence of a strong pro-UDF sentiment, aver UDF leaders.
It may be noted that in as many as eight constituencies, the poll percentage topped 80, which itself is a record. And most of these constituencies - among them are Kasaragod (80.57), Kannur which tops the list (83.05), Vadakara (82.48), Alathur (80.33) and Wayanad (80.31) –p are in the Malabar region.
This, the UDF leaders argue, is mainly due to the inspiring presence in the Wayanad poll fray of Congress president Rahul Gandhi. While the Rahul wave will have its impact all over the state, its effect will be most pronounced in the Malabar region, ensuring a virtual sweep of all the constituencies in the region, contends the UDF camp.
The aggressive and intimidating campaign launched by the saffron forces led by the BJP-RSS has ensured the total gravitation of minority votes towards the Congress-led UDF, claim UDF leaders. This, they also argue, is a total reversal of the pro-LDF minority voting witnessed in the 2016 State Assembly elections. If this is true, then that is extremely bad news for the LDF.
The LDF, however, has sought to counter this argument with their own reasoning. They feel nothing has happened to reverse the trend seen in the assembly elections. The unprecedented surge of minority votes for the LDF camp would be repeated in this election, too, aver the left leaders. The Lok Sabha election is a different ball game and here the calculations that mattered in the assembly polls would not matter, say however the seasoned political analysts.
There is a growing feeling among the minorities that in this crucial election. Congress is the party to look forward to; that is the only force which can stop the march of the communal forces led by the BJP. The left parties lack a national focus and do not matter at the national level. That is the crux of their argument. This, then, is the basis of the confidence in the Congress camp of a 20 out of 20 sweep in the State.
No matter how vehemently the left leaders argue, the Rahul factor seems to have influenced the voting pattern in the state. The mere presence of the Gandhi scion – a possible future Prime Minister – has electrified not only the Congress cadres but also those of its allies. Opinion has solidified among the minorities that Rahul alone can lead the post-poll front against the BJP-RSS duo.
As for the BJP, the party is hopeful of opening its Lok Sabha account from the state winning at least two seats, Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta. But the voting pattern has made the BJP a bit uneasy. To cite an instance: In Thiruvananthapuram, the UDF has done extremely well in its strongholds like Kovalam, Parassala and Neyyatinkara segments which witnessed very heavy polling.
However, in BJP bastions like Vattiyurkavu and Nemom, voting was not up to the expectations of the saffron forcers. This has raised the anxiety levels in the BJP camp. What has added to their unease is the excellent show by the CPI candidate C Divakaran in Kazhakkoottam constituency that is part of the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency. No wonder, Shashi Tharoor and his supporters are sporting a broad smile.
The BJP is not sure of bagging Pathanamthitta either, given the pattern of voting. True there has been an eight-point increase in the polling percentage. The Sabarimala factor has had a big impact, it seems. And the BJP-strongholds saw heavy polling, as a result. But this has been more than matched by heavy polling in minority-dominated constituencies that form part of Pathanamthitta.
This has raised the spirits in the UDF camp and deepened the lines on the foreheads of BJP leaders. This is the basis of the confidence of both LDF and UDF leaders that the BJP’s hopes of opening its account in Kerala will remain a dream.
The reaction of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to a question from media persons on high polling is a giveaway. A visibly angry Vijayan refused to answer the question but also snapped at the press persons asking them to ‘move away’! The CM’s body language has given the game away, claim opposition leaders.
LDF leaders, of course, make light of the dire predictions of both Congress and the BJP. They continue to predict that the LDF would put up a good show, winning majority of the seats from Kerala. All this talk of Rahul factor and minority consolidation are all products of a fertile UDF imagination and that Kerala will retain its reputation of being a Left bastion. That is their strong contention.

		<li><h2> Odisha Assembly polls: Naveen Patnaik may still be state's biggest leader, but cakewalk for BJD is unlikely</h2></li><br>
 The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) president and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, despite the heat and humidity, is on a marathon campaign for his party’s candidates. In all his poll meetings and roadshows, Patnaik continues to draw massive crowds. Everywhere, during his speeches, Patnaik asks, "Aaapan maane khushi to (are you all happy)?" The crowd goes berserk.
From his simple lifestyle, infectious smile to his laboured speeches, people of Odisha seem to love everything about Patnaik.
Personal popularity apart, his government’s series of pro-poor populist measures, active promotion to women-centric schemes, support to self-help groups and the BJD’s enviable grassroots level network have helped Patnaik reap rich electoral dividends in four successive polls.
Though he is likely to start his fifth innings as chief minister, it is believed the BJD will have to fight hard for each seat. In all probability, a cake walk, as witnessed in the past, is out of the question in 2019. Going by the poll narrative and the mood of the people, the Opposition, primarily the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), may upset the BJD, at least in many Lok Sabha seats.
“For the first time, Naveen is facing a serious challenge. It’s going to be a different election,” asserts senior journalist Prasanna Mohanty. According to him, it is nothing unusual to find large crowds in a four-time, serving chief minister’s election campaigns. But what’s not visible, apart from the undercurrents, is the silence of the voters. “Unlike in the past, this time, the voters are silent and that bothers the BJD,” he further says.

Congress’ state social media cell chairman Abhishek Mahananda doesn’t see any party securing a ‘clear mandate’ in 2019. “Results this time are going to be very dicey, and you will see no party having a clear mandate. There is a desperate competition between a party (BJD) that is in power and another (BJP) that wants to grab power. We are silently doing our work and the people are with us,” Mahananda, who is the Congress nominee for Cuttack Sadar Assembly seat, adds.
Without taking names of the BJD or its boss, BJP’s Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha candidate Aparajita Sarangi says she is yet to understand the meaning of the word ‘bastion’, commonly used to describe the BJD’s enviable grassroots level strength. “Where is the grave?” she asks. “That (the so called bastion) has been demolished and the reality is completely different today. I challenge all to visit with me the villages to see the truth,” declares the bureaucrat-turned politician.
Even some of the BJD’s senior leaders are skeptical and admit that the party’s confidence is missing. “The confidence with which the party entered the polls is missing now,” concedes a senior BJD leader.
Many believe Patnaik’s popularity had soared to unbeatable heights due to his attitude of zero tolerance to corruption. In the initial years of his rule, Patnaik would expel even senior leaders just on the basis of an allegation. But now, by giving political patronage (tickets) to those alleged to have links with the chit fund scam, or relatives of a few jailed leaders in the same scam, Patnaik has sent a different message to the people. “People still love the old Naveen who didn’t tolerate the corrupt or corruption. It’s difficult to say how they will view his change in stance,” thinks an Odisha politics watcher.
What also may not help the ruling party is the spate of poll violence cases in many of which its own workers, as alleged by the Opposition, are involved. Though in most such cases, both the BJD and BJP traded allegations on each other, the Congress remained silent.
However, as campaigning for the third phase poll in the state ended on 21 April — a week after BJP’s district level leader Manguli Jena was gunned down by unidentified gunmen at Khordha — Congress state unit president Niranjan Patnaik lodged an FIR against some BJD workers for an attack on him and a few of his associates in Anandpur of Keonjhar. On that day, both BJD and BJP had leveled charges against each other for attacks on their respective MLA candidates in Bhubaneswar.
Incidentally, the same night, an Election Commission of India team was attacked by six-time MLA, former minister and the BJD nominee for Pipli Assembly seat, Pradeep Maharathy, during a raid on his farmhouse, near Pipli in Puri district.
“Mr Maharathy himself rushed towards us and was seen directing his followers to attack us. We were severely beaten and had to flee from the spot,” Rabi Narayan Patra, the magistrate leading the flying squad told reporters at a hospital in Bhubaneswar. Subsequently, on the following day, much to the embarrassment of the BJD, Maharathy was arrested and sent to jail.
Though all political parties condemned the violent incidents, Congress and BJP attacked the ruling BJD. Mahananda says, “The BJD is a divided house. In every constituency, it’s facing challenges from its own rebel candidates. It is wary of the reality which it doesn’t want to face.”
BJP national secretary Suresh Pujari thinks the regional party’s workers are scared. The BJD never believed that ‘Naveen babu could be challenged’ and that’s why it’s angry. “No one is invincible in politics. Even Napoleon Bonaparte had been defeated in Waterloo. Indira Gandhi and Atalji had suffered defeats too,” Pujari, who is contesting for Bargarh Lok Sabha seat, says.
Senior BJD leader Tathagata Satpathy seemed concerned at the growing incidents of poll violence. “I am concerned at the high level of violence seen in the current election. A bad precedence is being set in a peace-loving state,” he says. “Whichever party, and this applies to all parties, is committing violence is only exposing its insecurity. Violence in elections shows a party’s extreme desperation,” adds the four-time Lok Sabha MP.
Satpathy also maintains that in democracy, the true bosses are the people and no one is invincible. “In democracy, nobody is invincible, whether it’s Mr Narendra Modi at Delhi or Mr Naveen Patnaik in Bhubaneswar. The true bosses are the people, not the leaders.”
For the time being, all eyes are on 23 May. Only the results will tell the truth.

		<li><h2> Mamata Banerjee responds to Modi's remarks about gifting kurtas, says he made a 'political issue' out of courtesy</h2></li><br>
		 Suri (West Bengal): West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is pretty cut up about Prime Minister Narendra Modi going public with the gift of kurtas and sweets that she sent him, saying he had made a "political issue" of the "courtesy" shown by her.
Modi had said in a televised interview on Tuesday that the Trinamool Congress supremo sends him kurtas, which she chooses personally for him, and Bengali sweets, every year.

"What is wrong in sending kurtas? We send gifts to many important people during Durga Puja. You are trying to make a political issue by divulging this information. I show you (Modi) so much courtesy and you come here and abuse me," Banerjee told an election rally.
She said she sends clothings made by famous weavers from her state and sweets to not only Modi but a hundred other people on their birthdays and other occasions but nobody made an issue out of it.
She claimed in doing so the prime minister was "trying to build his image, but this is not the way to do it".
Banerjee said she does not do the "politics of riots and murder" and asked whether Modi had forgotted the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002 when he was the chief minister.
The fiery TMC leader's angry outburst notwithstanding, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh was appreciative of Banerjee's gesture, saying it was the "right thing" to do and even calling her "our guardian".
"If Mamata Banerjee sent sweets, I think she did the right thing. If she has shown respect, I think there is no mistake in it. I also believe in the same principle and think that all politicians must do it," Ghosh told a press conference at the Kolkata Press Club.
He recalled how Banerjee called him up to inquire about his health when he was unwell.
"She is not only our chief minister but also our guardian," he said, apparently trying to use a dash of sweetness to cut through the poll-time acridity.

		<li><h2> Narendra Modi's roadshow in Varanasi was ‘carnival for the city’, say locals; top NDA allies confident BJP will deliver results if re-elected</h2></li><br>
		 

  
Varanasi: A day before filing his nomination for the Lok Sabha polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a mega roadshow on Thursday, drawing massive crowds, before culminating the show of strength with the "Ganga aarti" at the Dashashwamedh ghat.
Modi was joined by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior BJP leaders in the temple town, on a day the Congress ended the speculation over Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contesting the polls against the prime minister by announcing Ajay Rai's candidature from Varanasi.
Later, addressing a meeting, Modi said while the last five years were about his government making sincere efforts, the next five will be about results. He also laid stress on national security and said a new India gives a befitting reply to terror.

"Grateful for the warmth and affection!," Modi tweeted after the commencement of the seven-kilometre roadshow, which passed through several parts of the city, including the Lanka, Godhalio and Assi areas, amid a cheering crowd wearing saffron-coloured attires and showering rose petals.
The prime minister started his roadshow by garlanding the statue of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) founder Madan Mohan Malviya.
Wearing a saffron kurta and a white pyjama along with a matching saffron scarf, Modi waved at the people who lined up on both sides of the road and jostled to get a glimpse of him.
Modi is on a two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency and is scheduled to file his nomination on Friday in the presence of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders, including Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Modi, who contested from two seats — Varanasi and Vadodara in Gujarat — defeated Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from the former. Congress's Rai had finished third.
The nearly four-hour roadshow ended at the Dashashwamedh ghat, where Modi took part in the "Ganga aarti" along with Shah and Adityanath. Later, the prime minister also performed a puja.
Shyamlal Sharma (50), a local BJP worker who was wearing a saffron-coloured T-shirt with a graffiti saying "Modi forever", termed the roadshow a carnival for the city.
Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan are also expected to be present when the prime minister files his nomination, the BJP had said.
The Congress, however, alleged that Modi's roadshow was aimed at covering up his failure in honouring the promises made to the people of Varanasi and demanded that he should apologise for "betraying" them.
"Optics are more important than results and that is why the roadshow is being taken out, as the resolve of serving the people of Varanasi that Modiji had taken, the commitment he had shown to purify Ganga Ma, he has been completely unsuccessful in that," Congress spokesperson Ragini Nayak said.
The prime minister wants people's cries to get "drowned in today's noise and show", she alleged.
Addressing the meeting after the roadshow, Modi, in an apparent reference to the 14 February terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in south Kashmir, said, "They killed 40 jawans in Pulwama, we have killed 42 terrorists in that area."
He said this was the way his government functioned, adding that the world backed India in its fight against terror. The prime minister also referred to the recent bomb blasts in Sri Lanka, saying innocent people observing Easter lost their lives.
Talking about Varanasi, he said he would not claim that whatever he had wished for his constituency had come true in the last five years. But the pace and direction of its development were right, Modi said and outlined the work done by his government in Varanasi.
